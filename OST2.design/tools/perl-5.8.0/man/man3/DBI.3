Note also that whenever the \s-1DBI\s0 changes, the drivers take some time to
catch up. Recent versions of the \s-1DBI\s0 have added new features

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \s-1DBI\s0 is a database access module for the Perl programming language.  It defines
a set of methods, variables, and conventions that provide a consistent
database interface, independent of the actual database being used.
.PP
It is important to remember that the \s-1DBI\s0 is just an interface. 
The \s-1DBI\s0 is a layer
of \*(L"glue\*(R" between an application and one or more database \fIdriver\fR
modules.  It is the driver modules which do most of the real work. The \s-1DBI\s0
provides a standard interface and framework for the drivers to operate
within.

.PP
The \s-1API\s0, or Application Programming Interface, defines the 
call interface and variables for Perl scripts to use. The \s-1API\s0
is implemented by the Perl \s-1DBI\s0 extension.
.PP
The \s-1DBI\s0 \*(L"dispatches\*(R" the method calls to the appropriate driver for
actual execution.  The \s-1DBI\s0 is also responsible for the dynamic loading
of drivers, error checking and handling, providing default
implementations for methods, and many other non-database specific duties.
.PP
Each driver 
contains implementations of the \s-1DBI\s0 methods using the
private interface functions of the corresponding database engine.  Only authors
of sophisticated/multi\-database applications or generic library
functions need be concerned with drivers.
.Sh "Notation and Conventions"
.IX Subsection "Notation and Conventions"
The following conventions are used in this document:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&  $dbh    Database handle object
\&  $sth    Statement handle object
\&  $drh    Driver handle object (rarely seen or used in applications)
\&  $h      Any of the handle types above ($dbh, $sth, or $drh)
\&  $rc     General Return Code  (boolean: true=ok, false=error)
\&  $rv     General Return Value (typically an integer)
\&  @ary    List of values returned from the database, typically a row of data
\&  $rows   Number of rows processed (if available, else -1)
\&  $fh     A filehandle
\&  undef   NULL values are represented by undefined values in Perl
\&  \e%attr  Reference to a hash of attribute values passed to methods
.Ve
.PP
Note that Perl will automatically destroy database and statement handle objects
if all references to them are deleted.
.Sh "Outline Usage"
.IX Subsection "Outline Usage"
To use \s-1DBI\s0, 
first you need to load the \s-1DBI\s0 module:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use DBI;
\&  use strict;
.Ve
.PP
(The \f(CW\*(C`use strict;\*(C'\fR isn't required but is strongly recommended.)
.PP
Then you need to \*(L"connect\*(R" to your data source and get a \fIhandle\fR for that
connection:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $password,
\&                      { RaiseError => 1, AutoCommit => 0 });
.Ve
.PP
Since connecting can be expensive, you generally just connect at the
start of your program and disconnect at the end.
.PP
Explicitly defining the required \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR behavior is strongly
recommended and may become mandatory in a later version.  This
determines whether changes are automatically committed to the
database when executed, or need to be explicitly committed later.
.PP
The \s-1DBI\s0 allows an application to \*(L"prepare\*(R" statements for later
execution.  A prepared statement is identified by a statement handle
held in a Perl variable.
We'll call the Perl variable \f(CW$sth\fR in our examples.
.PP
The typical method call sequence for a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement is:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  prepare,
\&    execute, fetch, fetch, ...
\&    execute, fetch, fetch, ...
\&    execute, fetch, fetch, ...
.Ve
.PP
for example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT foo, bar FROM table WHERE baz=?");
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth->execute( $baz );
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  while ( @row = $sth->fetchrow_array ) {
\&    print "@row\en";
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
The typical method call sequence for a \fInon\fR\-\f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement is:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  prepare,
\&    execute,
\&    execute,
\&    execute.
.Ve
.PP
for example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $sth = $dbh->prepare("INSERT INTO table(foo,bar,baz) VALUES (?,?,?)");
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  while(<CSV>) {
\&    chomp;
\&    my ($foo,$bar,$baz) = split /,/;
\&        $sth->execute( $foo, $bar, $baz );
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`do()\*(C'\fR method can be used for non repeated \fInon\fR\-\f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement
(or with drivers that don't support placeholders):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $rows_affected = $dbh->do("UPDATE your_table SET foo = foo + 1");
.Ve
.PP
To commit your changes to the database (when \*(L"AutoCommit\*(R" is off):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh->commit;  # or call $dbh->rollback; to undo changes
.Ve
.PP
Finally, when you have finished working with the data source, you should
\&\*(L"disconnect\*(R" from it:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh->disconnect;
.Ve
.Sh "General Interface Rules & Caveats"
.IX Subsection "General Interface Rules & Caveats"
The \s-1DBI\s0 does not have a concept of a \*(L"current session\*(R". Every session
has a handle object (i.e., a \f(CW$dbh\fR) returned from the \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR method.
That handle object is used to invoke database related methods.
.PP
Most data is returned to the Perl script as strings. (Null values are
returned as \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.)  This allows arbitrary precision numeric data to be
handled without loss of accuracy.  Beware that Perl may not preserve
the same accuracy when the string is used as a number.
.PP
Dates and times are returned as character strings in the current
default format of the corresponding database engine.  Time zone effects
are database/driver dependent.
.PP
Perl supports binary data in Perl strings, and the \s-1DBI\s0 will pass binary
data to and from the driver without change. It is up to the driver
implementors to decide how they wish to handle such binary data.
.PP
Most databases that understand multiple character sets have a
default global charset. Text stored in the database is, or should
be, stored in that charset; if not, then that's the fault of either
the database or the application that inserted the data. When text is
fetched it should be automatically converted to the charset of the
client, presumably based on the locale. If a driver needs to set a
flag to get that behavior, then it should do so; it should not require
the application to do that.
.PP
Multiple \s-1SQL\s0 statements may not be combined in a single statement
handle (\f(CW$sth\fR), although some databases and drivers do support this
(notably Sybase and \s-1SQL\s0 Server).
.PP
Non-sequential record reads are not supported in this version of the \s-1DBI\s0.
In other words, records can only be fetched in the order that the
database returned them, and once fetched they are forgotten.
.PP
Positioned updates and deletes are not directly supported by the \s-1DBI\s0.
See the description of the \f(CW\*(C`CursorName\*(C'\fR attribute for an alternative.
.PP
Individual driver implementors are free to provide any private
functions and/or handle attributes that they feel are useful.
Private driver functions can be invoked using the \s-1DBI\s0 \f(CW\*(C`func()\*(C'\fR method.
Private driver attributes are accessed just like standard attributes.
.PP
Many methods have an optional \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR parameter which can be used to
pass information to the driver implementing the method. Except where
specifically documented, the \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR parameter can only be used to pass
driver specific hints. In general, you can ignore \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR parameters
or pass it as \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.Sh "Naming Conventions and Name Space"
.IX Subsection "Naming Conventions and Name Space"
The \s-1DBI\s0 package and all packages below it (\f(CW\*(C`DBI::*\*(C'\fR) are reserved for
use by the \s-1DBI\s0. Extensions and related modules use the \f(CW\*(C`DBIx::\*(C'\fR
namespace (see \f(CW\*(C`http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by\-module/DBIx/\*(C'\fR).
Package names beginning with \f(CW\*(C`DBD::\*(C'\fR are reserved for use
by \s-1DBI\s0 database drivers.  All environment variables used by the \s-1DBI\s0
or by individual DBDs begin with "\f(CW\*(C`DBI_\*(C'\fR\*(L" or \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`DBD_\*(C'\fR".
.PP
The letter case used for attribute names is significant and plays an
important part in the portability of \s-1DBI\s0 scripts.  The case of the
attribute name is used to signify who defined the meaning of that name
and its values.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  Case of name  Has a meaning defined by
\&  ------------  ------------------------
\&  UPPER_CASE    Standards, e.g.,  X/Open, ISO SQL92 etc (portable)
\&  MixedCase     DBI API (portable), underscores are not used.
\&  lower_case    Driver or database engine specific (non-portable)
.Ve
.PP
It is of the utmost importance that Driver developers only use
lowercase attribute names when defining private attributes. Private
attribute names must be prefixed with the driver name or suitable
abbreviation (e.g., "\f(CW\*(C`ora_\*(C'\fR\*(L" for Oracle, \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`ing_\*(C'\fR" for Ingres, etc).

.Sh "\s-1SQL\s0 \- A Query Language"
.IX Subsection "SQL - A Query Language"
Most \s-1DBI\s0 drivers require applications to use a dialect of \s-1SQL\s0 
(Structured Query Language) to interact with the database engine.
The following links provide useful information and further links about
\&\s-1SQL:\s0
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  http://www.altavista.com/query?q=sql+tutorial
\&  http://www.jcc.com/sql_stnd.html
\&  http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql.html
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1DBI\s0 itself does not mandate or require any particular language to
be used; it is language independent. In \s-1ODBC\s0 terms, the \s-1DBI\s0 is in
\&\*(L"pass\-thru\*(R" mode, although individual drivers might not be. The only requirement
is that queries and other statements must be expressed as a single
string of characters passed as the first argument to the \*(L"prepare\*(R" or
\&\*(L"do\*(R" methods.
.PP

.Sh "Placeholders and Bind Values"
.IX Subsection "Placeholders and Bind Values"
Some drivers support placeholders and bind values. 
\&\fIPlaceholders\fR, also called parameter markers, are used to indicate
values in a database statement that will be supplied later,
before the prepared statement is executed.  For example, an application
might use the following to insert a row of data into the \s-1SALES\s0 table:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  INSERT INTO sales (product_code, qty, price) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
.Ve
.PP
or the following, to select the description for a product:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  SELECT description FROM products WHERE product_code = ?

The \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR characters are the placeholders.  The association of actual
values with placeholders is known as \fIbinding\fR, and the values are
referred to as \fIbind values\fR.
.PP
When using placeholders with the \s-1SQL\s0 \f(CW\*(C`LIKE\*(C'\fR qualifier, you must
remember that the placeholder substitutes for the whole string.
So you should use "\f(CW\*(C`... LIKE ? ...\*(C'\fR" and include any wildcard
characters in the value that you bind to the placeholder.
.PP
\&\fBNull Values\fR
.PP
Undefined values, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, can be used to indicate null values.
However, care must be taken in the particular case of trying to use
null values to qualify a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement. Consider:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  SELECT description FROM products WHERE product_code = ?
.Ve
.PP
Binding an \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR (\s-1NULL\s0) to the placeholder will \fInot\fR select rows
which have a \s-1NULL\s0 \f(CW\*(C`product_code\*(C'\fR! Refer to the \s-1SQL\s0 manual for your database
engine or any \s-1SQL\s0 book for the reasons for this.  To explicitly select
NULLs you have to say "\f(CW\*(C`WHERE product_code IS NULL\*(C'\fR" and to make that
general you have to say:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ... WHERE (product_code = ? OR (? IS NULL AND product_code IS NULL))
.Ve
.PP
and bind the same value to both placeholders.
.PP
\&\fBPerformance\fR
.PP
Without using placeholders, the insert statement shown previously would have to
contain the literal values to be inserted and would have to be
re-prepared and re-executed for each row. With placeholders, the insert
statement only needs to be prepared once. The bind values for each row
can be given to the \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR method each time it's called. By avoiding
the need to re-prepare the statement for each row, the application
typically runs many times faster. Here's an example:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&  my $sth = $dbh->prepare(q{
\&    INSERT INTO sales (product_code, qty, price) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
\&  }) or die $dbh->errstr;
\&  while (<>) {
\&      chomp;
\&      my ($product_code, $qty, $price) = split /,/;
\&      $sth->execute($product_code, $qty, $price) or die $dbh->errstr;
\&  }
\&  $dbh->commit or die $dbh->errstr;
.Ve
.PP
See \*(L"execute\*(R" and \*(L"bind_param\*(R" for more details.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`q{...}\*(C'\fR style quoting used in this example avoids clashing with
quotes that may be used in the \s-1SQL\s0 statement. Use the double-quote like
\&\f(CW\*(C`qq{...}\*(C'\fR operator if you want to interpolate variables into the string.
See \*(L"Quote and Quote-like Operators\*(R" in perlop for more details.

variables with the output columns of a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement.

The following methods are provided by the \s-1DBI\s0 class:
.ie n .IP """connect""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWconnect\fR" 4
.IX Item "connect"
.Vb 4
\&  $dbh = DBI->connect($data_source, $username, $password)
\&            or die $DBI::errstr;
\&  $dbh = DBI->connect($data_source, $username, $password, \e%attr)
\&            or die $DBI::errstr;
.Ve
.Sp
Establishes a database connection, or session, to the requested \f(CW$data_source\fR.
Returns a database handle object if the connection succeeds. Use
\&\f(CW\*(C`$dbh\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`disconnect\*(C'\fR to terminate the connection.
.Sp
If the connect fails (see below), it returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR and sets both \f(CW$DBI::err\fR
and \f(CW$DBI::errstr\fR. (It does \fInot\fR set \f(CW$!\fR, etc.) You should generally
test the return status of \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`print $DBI::errstr\*(C'\fR if it has failed.
.Sp
Multiple simultaneous connections to multiple databases through multiple
drivers can be made via the \s-1DBI\s0. Simply make one \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR call for each
database and keep a copy of each returned database handle.
.Sp
The \f(CW$data_source\fR value should begin with "\f(CW\*(C`dbi:\*(C'\fR\fIdriver_name\fR\f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR". The
\&\fIdriver_name\fR specifies the driver that will be used to make the
connection. (Letter case is significant.)
.Sp
As a convenience, if the \f(CW$data_source\fR parameter is undefined or empty, the
\&\s-1DBI\s0 will substitute the value of the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`DBI_DSN\*(C'\fR.
If just the \fIdriver_name\fR part is empty (i.e., the \f(CW$data_source\fR prefix is "\f(CW\*(C`dbi::\*(C'\fR"),
the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`DBI_DRIVER\*(C'\fR is used. If neither variable is set,
then \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR dies.
.Sp
Examples of \f(CW$data_source\fR values are:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  dbi:DriverName:database_name
\&  dbi:DriverName:database_name@hostname:port
\&  dbi:DriverName:database=database_name;host=hostname;port=port
.Ve
.Sp
There is \fIno standard\fR for the text following the driver name. Each
driver is free to use whatever syntax it wants. The only requirement the
\&\s-1DBI\s0 makes is that all the information is supplied in a single string.
You must consult the documentation for the drivers you are using for a
description of the syntax they require. (Where a driver author needs
to define a syntax for the \f(CW$data_source\fR, it is recommended that
they follow the \s-1ODBC\s0 style, shown in the last example above.)
.Sp
If the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`DBI_AUTOPROXY\*(C'\fR is defined (and the driver in
\&\f(CW$data_source\fR is not "\f(CW\*(C`Proxy\*(C'\fR") then the connect request will
automatically be changed to:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbi:Proxy:$ENV{DBI_AUTOPROXY};dsn=$data_source
.Ve
.Sp
and passed to the DBD::Proxy module. \f(CW\*(C`DBI_AUTOPROXY\*(C'\fR is typically set as
"\f(CW\*(C`hostname=...;port=...\*(C'\fR". See the DBD::Proxy documentation for more details.
.Sp
If \f(CW$username\fR or \f(CW$password\fR are undefined (rather than just empty),
then the \s-1DBI\s0 will substitute the values of the \f(CW\*(C`DBI_USER\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`DBI_PASS\*(C'\fR
environment variables, respectively.  The \s-1DBI\s0 will warn if the
environment variables are not defined.  However, the everyday use of 
these environment 
variables is not recommended for security reasons. The mechanism is
primarily intended to simplify testing.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`DBI\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR automatically installs the driver if it has not been
installed yet. Driver installation either returns a valid driver
handle, or it \fIdies\fR with an error message that includes the string
"\f(CW\*(C`install_driver\*(C'\fR" and the underlying problem. So \f(CW\*(C`DBI\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR 
will die
on a driver installation failure and will only return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR on a
connect failure, in which case \f(CW$DBI::errstr\fR will hold the error message.
.Sp
The \f(CW$data_source\fR argument (with the "\f(CW\*(C`dbi:...:\*(C'\fR" prefix removed) and the
\&\f(CW$username\fR and \f(CW$password\fR arguments are then passed to the driver for
processing. The \s-1DBI\s0 does not define any interpretation for the
contents of these fields.  The driver is free to interpret the
\&\f(CW$data_source\fR, \f(CW$username\fR, and \f(CW$password\fR fields in any way, and supply
whatever defaults are appropriate for the engine being accessed.
(Oracle, for example, uses the \s-1ORACLE_SID\s0 and \s-1TWO_TASK\s0 environment 
variables if no \f(CW$data_source\fR is specified.)
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR attributes for each connection default to
\&\*(L"on\*(R". (See \*(L"AutoCommit\*(R" and \*(L"PrintError\*(R" for more information.)
However, it is strongly recommended that you explicitly define \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR
rather than rely on the default. Future versions of
the \s-1DBI\s0 may issue a warning if \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is not explicitly defined.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR parameter can be used to alter the default settings of 
\&\f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR, and other attributes. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  $dbh = DBI->connect($data_source, $user, $pass, {
\&        PrintError => 0,
\&        AutoCommit => 0
\&  });
.Ve
.Sp
You can also define connection attribute values within the \f(CW$data_source\fR
parameter. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  dbi:DriverName(PrintError=>0,Taint=>1):...
.Ve
.Sp
Individual attributes values specified in this way take precedence over
any conflicting values specified via the \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR parameter to \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`dbi_connect_method\*(C'\fR attribute can be used to specify which driver
method should be called to establish the connection. The only useful
values are 'connect', 'connect_cached', or some specialized case like
\&'Apache::DBI::connect' (which is automatically the default when running
within Apache).
.Sp
Where possible, each session (\f(CW$dbh\fR) is independent from the transactions
in other sessions. This is useful when you need to hold cursors open
across transactions\*(--for example, if you use one session for your long lifespan
cursors (typically read\-only) and another for your short update
transactions.
.Sp
For compatibility with old \s-1DBI\s0 scripts, the driver can be specified by
passing its name as the fourth argument to \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR (instead of \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR):
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $dbh = DBI->connect($data_source, $user, $pass, $driver);
.Ve
.Sp
In this \*(L"old\-style\*(R" form of \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR, the \f(CW$data_source\fR should not start
with "\f(CW\*(C`dbi:driver_name:\*(C'\fR". (If it does, the embedded driver_name
will be ignored). Also note that in this older form of \f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR, 
the \f(CW\*(C`$dbh\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`{AutoCommit}\*(C'\fR attribute is \fIundefined\fR, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`$dbh\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`{PrintError}\*(C'\fR attribute is off, and the old \f(CW\*(C`DBI_DBNAME\*(C'\fR
environment variable is
checked if \f(CW\*(C`DBI_DSN\*(C'\fR is not defined. Beware that this \*(L"old\-style\*(R" 
\&\f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR will be withdrawn in a future version of \s-1DBI\s0.

.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`connect_cached\*(C'\fR is like \*(L"connect\*(R", except that the database handle
returned is also
stored in a hash associated with the given parameters. If another call
is made to \f(CW\*(C`connect_cached\*(C'\fR with the same parameter values, then the
corresponding cached \f(CW$dbh\fR will be returned if it is still valid.
The cached database handle is replaced with a new connection if it
has been disconnected or if the \f(CW\*(C`ping\*(C'\fR method fails.
.Sp
Note that the behavior of this method differs in several respects from the
behavior of presistent connections implemented by Apache::DBI.
.Sp
Caching can be useful in some applications, but it can also cause
problems and should be used with care. The exact behavior of this
method is liable to change, so if you intend to use it in any production
applications you should discuss your needs on the \fIdbi-users\fR mailing list.

Trace level 1 is best for a simple overview of what's happening.
Trace level 2 is a good choice for general purpose tracing.  Levels 3

.Sp
The trace output is detailed and typically very useful. Much of the
trace output is formatted using the \*(L"neat\*(R" function, so strings
in the trace output may be edited and truncated.
.Sp
Initially trace output is written to \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR.  If \f(CW$trace_filename\fR is
specified and can be opened in append mode then all trace
output (including that from other handles) is redirected to that file.
A warning is generated is the file can't be opened.
Further calls to \f(CW\*(C`trace\*(C'\fR without a \f(CW$trace_filename\fR do not alter where
the trace output is sent. If \f(CW$trace_filename\fR is undefined, then
trace output is sent to \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR and the previous trace file is closed.
The \f(CW\*(C`trace\*(C'\fR method returns the \fIprevious\fR tracelevel.

The \s-1DBI\s0 resets \f(CW$h\fR\->err to undef before most \s-1DBI\s0 method calls, so the

one handle will typically reset the error on all the other handles
that are children of that driver.

Initially, trace output is written to \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR.  If \f(CW$trace_filename\fR is
specified, then the file is opened in append mode and \fIall\fR trace
output (including that from other handles) is redirected to that file.
Further calls to trace without a \f(CW$trace_filename\fR do not alter where
the trace output is sent. If \f(CW$trace_filename\fR is undefined, then
trace output is sent to \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR and the previous trace file is closed.
.Sp
See also the \f(CW\*(C`DBI\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`trace\*(C'\fR method and \*(L"\s-1DEBUGGING\s0\*(R" for information

.SH "ATTRIBUTES COMMON TO ALL HANDLES"
.IX Header "ATTRIBUTES COMMON TO ALL HANDLES"
These attributes are common to all types of \s-1DBI\s0 handles.
.PP
Some attributes are inherited by child handles. That is, the value
of an inherited attribute in a newly created statement handle is the
same as the value in the parent database handle. Changes to attributes
in the new statement handle do not affect the parent database handle
and changes to the database handle do not affect existing statement
handles, only future ones.
.PP
Attempting to set or get the value of an unknown attribute is fatal,
except for private driver specific attributes (which all have names
starting with a lowercase letter).
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $h->{AttributeName} = ...;    # set/write
\&  ... = $h->{AttributeName};    # get/read
.Ve
.ie n .IP """Warn"" (boolean, inherited)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWWarn\fR (boolean, inherited)" 4
.IX Item "Warn (boolean, inherited)"
Enables useful warnings for certain bad practices. Enabled by default. Some
emulation layers, especially those for Perl 4 interfaces, disable warnings.
Since warnings are generated using the Perl \f(CW\*(C`warn\*(C'\fR function, they can be
intercepted using the Perl \f(CW$SIG{_\|_WARN_\|_}\fR hook.
.ie n .IP """Active"" (boolean, read\-only)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWActive\fR (boolean, read\-only)" 4
.IX Item "Active (boolean, read-only)"
True if the handle object is \*(L"active\*(R". This is rarely used in
applications. The exact meaning of active is somewhat vague at the
moment. For a database handle it typically means that the handle is
connected to a database (\f(CW\*(C`$dbh\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`disconnect\*(C'\fR sets \f(CW\*(C`Active\*(C'\fR off).  For
a statement handle it typically means that the handle is a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR
that may have more data to fetch. (Fetching all the data or calling \f(CW\*(C`$sth\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR
sets \f(CW\*(C`Active\*(C'\fR off.)
.ie n .IP """Kids"" (integer, read\-only)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWKids\fR (integer, read\-only)" 4
.IX Item "Kids (integer, read-only)"
For a driver handle, \f(CW\*(C`Kids\*(C'\fR is the number of currently existing database
handles that were created from that driver handle.  For a database
handle, \f(CW\*(C`Kids\*(C'\fR is the number of currently existing statement handles that
were created from that database handle.
.ie n .IP """ActiveKids"" (integer, read\-only)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWActiveKids\fR (integer, read\-only)" 4

.ie n .IP """CachedKids"" (hash ref)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWCachedKids\fR (hash ref)" 4
.IX Item "CachedKids (hash ref)"
For a database handle, returns a reference to the cache (hash) of
statement handles created by the \*(L"prepare_cached\*(R" method.  For a
driver handle, returns a reference to the cache (hash) of
database handles created by the \*(L"connect_cached\*(R" method.
.ie n .IP """CompatMode"" (boolean, inherited)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWCompatMode\fR (boolean, inherited)" 4
.IX Item "CompatMode (boolean, inherited)"
Used by emulation layers (such as Oraperl) to enable compatible behavior
in the underlying driver (e.g., DBD::Oracle) for this handle. Not normally
set by application code.
.ie n .IP """InactiveDestroy"" (boolean)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWInactiveDestroy\fR (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "InactiveDestroy (boolean)"
This attribute can be used to disable the \fIdatabase engine\fR related
effect of DESTROYing a handle (which would normally close a prepared
statement or disconnect from the database etc).
.Sp
For a database handle, this attribute does not disable an \fIexplicit\fR
call to the disconnect method, only the implicit call from \s-1DESTROY\s0.
.Sp
This attribute is specifically designed for use in Unix applications
that \*(L"fork\*(R" child processes. Either the parent or the child process,
but not both, should set \f(CW\*(C`InactiveDestroy\*(C'\fR on all their shared handles.
Note that some databases, including Oracle, don't support passing a
database connection across a fork.
.ie n .IP """PrintError"" (boolean, inherited)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWPrintError\fR (boolean, inherited)" 4
.IX Item "PrintError (boolean, inherited)"
This attribute can be used to force errors to generate warnings (using
\&\f(CW\*(C`warn\*(C'\fR) in addition to returning error codes in the normal way.  When set
\&\*(L"on\*(R", any method which results in an error occuring will cause the \s-1DBI\s0 to
effectively do a \f(CW\*(C`warn("$class $method failed: $DBI::errstr")\*(C'\fR where \f(CW$class\fR
is the driver class and \f(CW$method\fR is the name of the method which failed. E.g.,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  DBD::Oracle::db prepare failed: ... error text here ...
.Ve
.Sp
By default, \f(CW\*(C`DBI\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`connect\*(C'\fR sets \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR \*(L"on\*(R".
.Sp
If desired, the warnings can be caught and processed using a \f(CW$SIG{_\|_WARN_\|_}\fR
handler or modules like CGI::Carp and CGI::ErrorWrap.
.ie n .IP """RaiseError"" (boolean, inherited)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWRaiseError\fR (boolean, inherited)" 4
.IX Item "RaiseError (boolean, inherited)"
This attribute can be used to force errors to raise exceptions rather
than simply return error codes in the normal way. It is \*(L"off\*(R" by default.
When set \*(L"on\*(R", any method which results in an error will cause
the \s-1DBI\s0 to effectively do a \f(CW\*(C`die("$class $method failed: $DBI::errstr")\*(C'\fR,
where \f(CW$class\fR is the driver class and \f(CW$method\fR is the name of the method
that failed. E.g.,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  DBD::Oracle::db prepare failed: ... error text here ...
.Ve
.Sp
If you turn \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR on then you'd normally turn \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR off.
If \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR is also on, then the \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR is done first (naturally).
.Sp
Typically \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR is used in conjunction with \f(CW\*(C`eval { ... }\*(C'\fR
to catch the exception that's been thrown and followed by an
\&\f(CW\*(C`if ($@) { ... }\*(C'\fR block to handle the caught exception. In that eval
block the \f(CW$DBI::lasth\fR variable can be useful for diagnosis and reporting.
For example, \f(CW$DBI::lasth\fR\->{Type} and \f(CW$DBI::lasth\fR\->{Statement}.
.Sp
If you want to temporarily turn \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR off (inside a library function
that is likely to fail, for example), the recommended way is like this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  {
\&    local $h->{RaiseError};  # localize and turn off for this block
\&    ...
\&  }
.Ve
.Sp
The original value will automatically and reliably be restored by Perl,
regardless of how the block is exited.
The same logic applies to other attributes, including \f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Sadly, this doesn't work for Perl versions up to and including 5.004_04.
Even more sadly, for Perl 5.5 and 5.6.0 it does work but leaks memory!
For backwards compatibility, you could just use \f(CW\*(C`eval { ... }\*(C'\fR instead.

.el .IP "\f(CWShowErrorStatement\fR (boolean, inherited) \fI\s-1NEW\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "ShowErrorStatement (boolean, inherited) NEW"
This attribute can be used to cause the relevant Statement text to be
appended to the error messages generated by the \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`PrintError\*(C'\fR attributes. Only applies to errors on statement handles
plus the \fIprepare()\fR and \fIdo()\fR database handle methods.
(The exact format of the appended text is subject to change.)
.ie n .IP """ChopBlanks"" (boolean, inherited)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWChopBlanks\fR (boolean, inherited)" 4
.IX Item "ChopBlanks (boolean, inherited)"
This attribute can be used to control the trimming of trailing space
characters from fixed width character (\s-1CHAR\s0) fields. No other field
types are affected, even where field values have trailing spaces.
.Sp
The default is false (although it is possible that the default may change).
Applications that need specific behavior should set the attribute as
needed. Emulation interfaces should set the attribute to match the
behavior of the interface they are emulating.
.Sp
Drivers are not required to support this attribute, but any driver which
does not support it must arrange to return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR as the attribute value.
.ie n .IP """LongReadLen"" (unsigned integer, inherited)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWLongReadLen\fR (unsigned integer, inherited)" 4
.IX Item "LongReadLen (unsigned integer, inherited)"
This attribute may be used to control the maximum length of long fields
(\*(L"blob\*(R", \*(L"memo\*(R", etc.) which the driver will read from the
database automatically when it fetches each row of data.  The
\&\f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR attribute only relates to fetching and reading long values; it
is not involved in inserting or updating them.
.Sp
A value of 0 means not to automatically fetch any long data. (\f(CW\*(C`fetch\*(C'\fR
should return \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR for long fields when \f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR is 0.)
.Sp
The default is typically 0 (zero) bytes but may vary between drivers.
Applications fetching long fields should set this value to slightly
larger than the longest long field value to be fetched.
.Sp
Some databases return some long types encoded as pairs of hex digits.
For these types, \f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR relates to the underlying data length and not the
doubled-up length of the encoded string.
.Sp
Changing the value of \f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR for a statement handle after it
has been \f(CW\*(C`prepare\*(C'\fR'd will typically have no effect, so it's common to
set \f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR on the \f(CW$dbh\fR before calling \f(CW\*(C`prepare\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Note that the value used here has a direct effect on the memory used
by the application, so don't be too generous.
.Sp
See \*(L"LongTruncOk\*(R" for more information on truncation behavior.
.ie n .IP """LongTruncOk"" (boolean, inherited)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWLongTruncOk\fR (boolean, inherited)" 4
.IX Item "LongTruncOk (boolean, inherited)"
This attribute may be used to control the effect of fetching a long
field value which has been truncated (typically because it's longer
than the value of the \f(CW\*(C`LongReadLen\*(C'\fR attribute).
.Sp
By default, \f(CW\*(C`LongTruncOk\*(C'\fR is false and so fetching a long value that
needs to be truncated will cause the fetch to fail.
(Applications should always be sure to
check for errors after a fetch loop in case an error, such as a divide
by zero or long field truncation, caused the fetch to terminate
prematurely.)
.Sp
If a fetch fails due to a long field truncation when \f(CW\*(C`LongTruncOk\*(C'\fR is
false, many drivers will allow you to continue fetching further rows.
.Sp
See also \*(L"LongReadLen\*(R".
.ie n .IP """Taint"" (boolean, inherited)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWTaint\fR (boolean, inherited)" 4
.IX Item "Taint (boolean, inherited)"
If this attribute is set to a true value \fIand\fR Perl is running in
taint mode (e.g., started with the \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR option), then all data
fetched from the database is tainted, and the arguments to most \s-1DBI\s0
method calls are checked for being tainted. \fIThis may change.\fR
.Sp
The attribute defaults to off, even if Perl is in taint mode.
See perlsec for more about taint mode.  If Perl is not
running in taint mode, this attribute has no effect.
.Sp
When fetching data that you trust you can turn off the Taint attribute,
for that statement handle, for the duration of the fetch loop.
.Sp
Currently only fetched data is tainted. It is possible that the results
of other \s-1DBI\s0 method calls, and the value of fetched attributes, may
also be tainted in future versions. That change may well break your
applications unless you take great care now. If you use \s-1DBI\s0 Taint mode,
please report your experience and any suggestions for changes.
.ie n .IP """private_*""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWprivate_*\fR" 4
.IX Item "private_*"
The \s-1DBI\s0 provides a way to store extra information in a \s-1DBI\s0 handle as
\&\*(L"private\*(R" attributes. The \s-1DBI\s0 will allow you to store and retreive any
attribute which has a name starting with "\f(CW\*(C`private_\*(C'\fR". It is strongly
recommended that you use just \fIone\fR private attribute (e.g., use a
hash ref) and give it a long and unambiguous name that includes the
module or application name that the attribute relates to (e.g.,
"\f(CW\*(C`private_YourFullModuleName_thingy\*(C'\fR").
.SH "DBI DATABASE HANDLE OBJECTS"
.IX Header "DBI DATABASE HANDLE OBJECTS"
This section covers the methods and attributes associated with
database handles.
.Sh "Database Handle Methods"
.IX Subsection "Database Handle Methods"
The following methods are specified for \s-1DBI\s0 database handles:
.ie n .IP """do""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWdo\fR" 4
.IX Item "do"
.Vb 3
\&  $rc  = $dbh->do($statement)           or die $dbh->errstr;
\&  $rc  = $dbh->do($statement, \e%attr)   or die $dbh->errstr;
\&  $rv  = $dbh->do($statement, \e%attr, @bind_values) or ...
.Ve
.Sp
Prepare and execute a single statement. Returns the number of rows
affected or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR on error. A return value of \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR means the 
number of rows is not known or is not available.
.Sp
This method is typically most useful for \fInon\fR\-\f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements that
either cannot be prepared in advance (due to a limitation of the
driver) or do not need to be executed repeatedly. It should not
be used for \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements because it does not return a statement
handle (so you can't fetch any data).
.Sp
The default \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR method is logically similar to:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&  sub do {
\&      my($dbh, $statement, $attr, @bind_values) = @_;
\&      my $sth = $dbh->prepare($statement, $attr) or return undef;
\&      $sth->execute(@bind_values) or return undef;
\&      my $rows = $sth->rows;
\&      ($rows == 0) ? "0E0" : $rows; # always return true if no error
\&  }
.Ve
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  my $rows_deleted = $dbh->do(q{
\&      DELETE FROM table
\&      WHERE status = ?
\&  }, undef, 'DONE') or die $dbh->errstr;
.Ve
.Sp
Using placeholders and \f(CW@bind_values\fR with the \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR method can be
useful because it avoids the need to correctly quote any variables
in the \f(CW$statement\fR. But if you'll be executing the statement many
times then it's more efficient to \f(CW\*(C`prepare\*(C'\fR it once and call
\&\f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR many times instead.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`q{...}\*(C'\fR style quoting used in this example avoids clashing with
quotes that may be used in the \s-1SQL\s0 statement. Use the double-quote-like
\&\f(CW\*(C`qq{...}\*(C'\fR operator if you want to interpolate variables into the string.
See \*(L"Quote and Quote-like Operators\*(R" in perlop for more details.

This utility method combines \*(L"prepare\*(R", \*(L"execute\*(R" and
\&\*(L"fetchrow_array\*(R" into a single call. If called in a list context, it
returns the first row of data from the statement. If called in a scalar
context, it returns the first field of the first row. The \f(CW$statement\fR
parameter can be a previously prepared statement handle, in which case
the \f(CW\*(C`prepare\*(C'\fR is skipped.
.Sp
If any method fails, and \*(L"RaiseError\*(R" is not set, \f(CW\*(C`selectrow_array\*(C'\fR
will return an empty list.
.Sp
In a scalar context, \f(CW\*(C`selectrow_array\*(C'\fR returns the value of the first
field. An \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is returned if there are no matching rows or an error
occurred. Since that \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR can't be distinguished from an \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR returned
because the first field value was \s-1NULL\s0, calling \f(CW\*(C`selectrow_array\*(C'\fR in
a scalar context should be used with caution.

.Sp
Prepares a single statement for later execution by the database
engine and returns a reference to a statement handle object.
.Sp
The returned statement handle can be used to get attributes of the
statement and invoke the \*(L"execute\*(R" method. See \*(L"Statement Handle Methods\*(R".
.Sp
Drivers for engines without the concept of preparing a
statement will typically just store the statement in the returned
handle and process it when \f(CW\*(C`$sth\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR is called. Such drivers are
unlikely to give much useful information about the
statement, such as \f(CW\*(C`$sth\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`{NUM_OF_FIELDS}\*(C'\fR, until after \f(CW\*(C`$sth\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR
has been called. Portable applications should take this into account.
.Sp
In general, \s-1DBI\s0 drivers do not parse the contents of the statement
(other than simply counting any \*(L"Placeholders\*(R"). The statement is
passed directly to the database engine, sometimes known as pass-thru
mode. This has advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, you can
access all the functionality of the engine being used. On the downside,
you're limited if you're using a simple engine, and you need to take extra care if
writing applications intended to be portable between engines.
.Sp
Portable applications should not assume that a new statement can be
prepared and/or executed while still fetching results from a previous
statement.
.Sp
Some command-line \s-1SQL\s0 tools use statement terminators, like a semicolon,
to indicate the end of a statement. Such terminators should not normally
be used with the \s-1DBI\s0.

This caching can be useful in some applications, but it can also cause
problems and should be used with care. If the cached \f(CW$sth\fR being
returned is active (i.e., is a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR that may still have data to be
fetched) then a warning will be generated and \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR will be called
for you.  The warning can be suppressed by setting \f(CW$allow_active\fR to
true.  The cache can be accessed (and cleared) via the \*(L"CachedKids\*(R"
attribute.
.Sp
Here's an example of one possible use of \f(CW\*(C`prepare_cached\*(C'\fR:

.Ve
.Sp
Disconnects the database from the database handle. \f(CW\*(C`disconnect\*(C'\fR is typically only used
before exiting the program. The handle is of little use after disconnecting.
.Sp
The transaction behavior of the \f(CW\*(C`disconnect\*(C'\fR method is, sadly,
undefined.  Some database systems (such as Oracle and Ingres) will
automatically commit any outstanding changes, but others (such as
Informix) will rollback any outstanding changes.  Applications not
using \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR should explicitly call \f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`rollback\*(C'\fR before
calling \f(CW\*(C`disconnect\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The database is automatically disconnected by the \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR method if
still connected when there are no longer any references to the handle.
The \f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR method for each driver should implicitly call \f(CW\*(C`rollback\*(C'\fR to
undo any uncommitted changes. This is vital behavior to ensure that
incomplete transactions don't get committed simply because Perl calls
\&\f(CW\*(C`DESTROY\*(C'\fR on every object before exiting. Also, do not rely on the order
of object destruction during \*(L"global destruction\*(R", as it is undefined.
.Sp
Generally, if you want your changes to be commited or rolled back when
you disconnect, then you should explicitly call \*(L"commit\*(R" or \*(L"rollback\*(R"
before disconnecting.
.Sp
If you disconnect from a database while you still have active statement
handles, you will get a warning. The statement handles should either be
cleared (destroyed) before disconnecting, or the \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR method 
should be called on
each one.

.Sh "Database Handle Attributes"
.IX Subsection "Database Handle Attributes"
This section describes attributes specific to database handles.
.PP
Changes to these database handle attributes do not affect any other
existing or future database handles.
.PP
Attempting to set or get the value of an unknown attribute is fatal,
except for private driver-specific attributes (which all have names
starting with a lowercase letter).
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  $h->{AutoCommit} = ...;       # set/write
\&  ... = $h->{AutoCommit};       # get/read
.Ve
.ie n .IP """AutoCommit""  (boolean)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWAutoCommit\fR  (boolean)" 4
.IX Item "AutoCommit  (boolean)"
If true, then database changes cannot be rolled-back (undone).  If false,
then database changes automatically occur within a \*(L"transaction\*(R", which
must either be committed or rolled back using the \f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`rollback\*(C'\fR
methods.
.Sp
Drivers should always default to \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR mode (an unfortunate
choice largely forced on the \s-1DBI\s0 by \s-1ODBC\s0 and \s-1JDBC\s0 conventions.)
.Sp
Attempting to set \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR to an unsupported value is a fatal error.
This is an important feature of the \s-1DBI\s0. Applications that need
full transaction behavior can set \f(CW\*(C`$dbh\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`{AutoCommit} = 0\*(C'\fR (or
set \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR to 0 via \*(L"connect\*(R") 
without having to check that the value was assigned successfully.
.Sp
For the purposes of this description, we can divide databases into three
categories:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  Databases which don't support transactions at all.
\&  Databases in which a transaction is always active.
\&  Databases in which a transaction must be explicitly started (C<'BEGIN WORK'>).
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fB* Databases which don't support transactions at all\fR
.Sp
For these databases, attempting to turn \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR off is a fatal error.
\&\f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`rollback\*(C'\fR both issue warnings about being ineffective while
\&\f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is in effect.
.Sp
\&\fB* Databases in which a transaction is always active\fR
.Sp
These are typically mainstream commercial relational databases with
\&\*(L"\s-1ANSI\s0 standard\*(R" transaction behavior.
If \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is off, then changes to the database won't have any
lasting effect unless \*(L"commit\*(R" is called (but see also
\&\*(L"disconnect\*(R"). If \*(L"rollback\*(R" is called then any changes since the
last commit are undone.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is on, then the effect is the same as if the \s-1DBI\s0 
called \f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fR automatically after every successful database
operation. In other words, calling \f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`rollback\*(C'\fR explicitly while
\&\f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is on would be ineffective because the changes would
have already been commited.
.Sp
Changing \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR from off to on should issue a \*(L"commit\*(R" in most drivers.
.Sp
Changing \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR from on to off should have no immediate effect.
.Sp
For databases which don't support a specific auto-commit mode, the
driver has to commit each statement automatically using an explicit
\&\f(CW\*(C`COMMIT\*(C'\fR after it completes successfully (and roll it back using an
explicit \f(CW\*(C`ROLLBACK\*(C'\fR if it fails).  The error information reported to the
application will correspond to the statement which was executed, unless
it succeeded and the commit or rollback failed.
.Sp
\&\fB* Databases in which a transaction must be explicitly started\fR
.Sp
For these databases, the intention is to have them act like databases in
which a transaction is always active (as described above).
.Sp
To do this, the \s-1DBI\s0 driver will automatically begin a transaction when
\&\f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is turned off (from the default \*(L"on\*(R" state) and will
automatically begin another transaction after a \*(L"commit\*(R" or \*(L"rollback\*(R".
In this way, the application does not have to treat these databases as a
special case.
.Sp
See \*(L"commit\*(R", \*(L"disconnect\*(R" and \*(L"Transactions\*(R" for other important
notes about transactions.

but with the leading \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`dbi:DriverName:\*(C'\fR" removed.
.ie n .IP """Statement""  (string, read\-only)" 4

called in this database handle, even if that method failed. This is especially
useful where \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR is enabled and the exception handler checks $@
and sees that a 'prepare' method call failed.
.ie n .IP """RowCacheSize""  (integer)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWRowCacheSize\fR  (integer)" 4
.IX Item "RowCacheSize  (integer)"
A hint to the driver indicating the size of the local row cache that the
application would like the driver to use for future \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements.
If a row cache is not implemented, then setting \f(CW\*(C`RowCacheSize\*(C'\fR is ignored
and getting the value returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Some \f(CW\*(C`RowCacheSize\*(C'\fR values have special meaning, as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  0 - Automatically determine a reasonable cache size for each C<SELECT>
\&  1 - Disable the local row cache
\& >1 - Cache this many rows
\& <0 - Cache as many rows that will fit into this much memory for each C<SELECT>.
.Ve
.Sp
Note that large cache sizes may require a very large amount of memory
(\fIcached rows * maximum size of row\fR). Also, a large cache will cause
a longer delay not only for the first fetch, but also whenever the 
cache needs refilling.
.Sp

.SH "DBI STATEMENT HANDLE OBJECTS"
.IX Header "DBI STATEMENT HANDLE OBJECTS"
This section lists the methods and attributes associated with \s-1DBI\s0
statement handles.
.Sh "Statement Handle Methods"
.IX Subsection "Statement Handle Methods"
The \s-1DBI\s0 defines the following methods for use on \s-1DBI\s0 statement handles:
.ie n .IP """bind_param""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWbind_param\fR" 4
.IX Item "bind_param"
.Vb 3
\&  $rc = $sth->bind_param($p_num, $bind_value)  or die $sth->errstr;
\&  $rv = $sth->bind_param($p_num, $bind_value, \e%attr)     or ...
\&  $rv = $sth->bind_param($p_num, $bind_value, $bind_type) or ...
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR method can be used to bind a value
with a placeholder embedded in the prepared statement. Placeholders
are indicated with question mark character (\f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR). For example:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  $dbh->{RaiseError} = 1;        # save having to check each method call
\&  $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT name, age FROM people WHERE name LIKE ?");
\&  $sth->bind_param(1, "John%");  # placeholders are numbered from 1
\&  $sth->execute;
\&  DBI::dump_results($sth);
.Ve
.Sp
Note that the \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR is not enclosed in quotation marks, even when the
placeholder represents a string.  Some drivers also allow placeholders
like \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR\fIname\fR and \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR\fIn\fR (e.g., \f(CW\*(C`:1\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`:2\*(C'\fR, and so on)
in addition to \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR, but their use
is not portable.  Undefined bind values or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR can be used to
indicate null values.
.Sp
Some drivers do not support placeholders.
.Sp
With most drivers, placeholders can't be used for any element of a
statement that would prevent the database server from validating the
statement and creating a query execution plan for it. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  "SELECT name, age FROM ?"         # wrong (will probably fail)
\&  "SELECT name, ?   FROM people"    # wrong (but may not 'fail')
.Ve
.Sp
Also, placeholders can only represent single scalar values.
For example, the following
statement won't work as expected for more than one value:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  "SELECT name, age FROM people WHERE name IN (?)"    # wrong
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fBData Types for Placeholders\fR
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR parameter can be used to hint at the data type the
placeholder should have. Typically, the driver is only interested in
knowing if the placeholder should be bound as a number or a string.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $sth->bind_param(1, $value, { TYPE => SQL_INTEGER });
.Ve
.Sp
As a short-cut for this common case, the data type can be passed
directly, in place of the \f(CW\*(C`\e%attr\*(C'\fR hash reference. This example is
equivalent to the one above:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $sth->bind_param(1, $value, SQL_INTEGER);
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`TYPE\*(C'\fR value indicates the standard (non\-driver\-specific) type for
this parameter. To specify the driver-specific type, the driver may
support a driver-specific attribute, such as \f(CW\*(C`{ ora_type =\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C` 97 }\*(C'\fR.  The
data type for a placeholder cannot be changed after the first
\&\f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR call. However, it can be left unspecified, in which case it
defaults to the previous value.
.Sp
The \s-1SQL_INTEGER\s0 and other related constants can be imported using
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  use DBI qw(:sql_types);
.Ve
.Sp
See \*(L"\s-1DBI\s0 Constants\*(R" for more information.
.Sp
Perl only has string and number scalar data types. All database types
that aren't numbers are bound as strings and must be in a format the
database will understand.
.Sp
As an alternative to specifying the data type in the \f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR call,
you can let the driver pass the value as the default type (\f(CW\*(C`VARCHAR\*(C'\fR).
You can then use an \s-1SQL\s0 function to convert the type within the statement.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  INSERT INTO price(code, price) VALUES (?, CONVERT(MONEY,?))
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`CONVERT\*(C'\fR function used here is just an example. The actual function
and syntax will vary between different databases and is non\-portable.
.Sp
See also \*(L"Placeholders and Bind Values\*(R" for more information.
.ie n .IP """bind_param_inout""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWbind_param_inout\fR" 4
.IX Item "bind_param_inout"
.Vb 3
\&  $rc = $sth->bind_param_inout($p_num, \e$bind_value, $max_len)  or die $sth->errstr;
\&  $rv = $sth->bind_param_inout($p_num, \e$bind_value, $max_len, \e%attr)     or ...
\&  $rv = $sth->bind_param_inout($p_num, \e$bind_value, $max_len, $bind_type) or ...
.Ve
.Sp
This method acts like \*(L"bind_param\*(R", but also enables values to be
updated by the statement. The statement is typically
a call to a stored procedure. The \f(CW$bind_value\fR must be passed as a
reference to the actual value to be used.
.Sp
Note that unlike \*(L"bind_param\*(R", the \f(CW$bind_value\fR variable is not
read when \f(CW\*(C`bind_param_inout\*(C'\fR is called. Instead, the value in the
variable is read at the time \*(L"execute\*(R" is called.
.Sp
The additional \f(CW$max_len\fR parameter specifies the minimum amount of
memory to allocate to \f(CW$bind_value\fR for the new value. If the value
returned from the database is too
big to fit, then the execution should fail. If unsure what value to use,
pick a generous length, i.e., a length larger than the longest value that would ever be
returned.  The only cost of using a larger value than needed is wasted memory.
.Sp
It is expected that few drivers will support this method. The only
driver currently known to do so is DBD::Oracle (\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 may support
it in a future release). Therefore it should not be used for database
independent applications.
.Sp
Undefined values or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR are used to indicate null values.
See also \*(L"Placeholders and Bind Values\*(R" for more information.
.ie n .IP """execute""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWexecute\fR" 4
.IX Item "execute"
.Vb 2
\&  $rv = $sth->execute                or die $sth->errstr;
\&  $rv = $sth->execute(@bind_values)  or die $sth->errstr;
.Ve
.Sp
Perform whatever processing is necessary to execute the prepared
statement.  An \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is returned if an error occurs.  A successful
\&\f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR always returns true regardless of the number of rows affected,
even if it's zero (see below). It is always important to check the
return status of \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR (and most other \s-1DBI\s0 methods) for errors.
.Sp
For a \fInon\fR\-\f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement, \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR returns the number of rows
affected, if known. If no rows were affected, then \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR returns
"\f(CW0E0\fR", which Perl will treat as 0 but will regard as true. Note that it
is \fInot\fR an error for no rows to be affected by a statement. If the
number of rows affected is not known, then \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR returns \-1.
.Sp
For \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements, execute simply \*(L"starts\*(R" the query within the
database engine. Use one of the fetch methods to retreive the data after
calling \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR.  The \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR method does \fInot\fR return the number of
rows that will be returned by the query (because most databases can't
tell in advance), it simply returns a true value.
.Sp
If any arguments are given, then \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR will effectively call
\&\*(L"bind_param\*(R" for each value before executing the statement.
Values bound in this way are usually treated as \f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR types
unless the driver can determine the correct type (which is rare), or
unless
\&\f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`bind_param_inout\*(C'\fR) has already been used to specify the
type.

Fetches the next row of data and returns a reference to an array
holding the field values.  Null fields are returned as \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR

\&\f(CW\*(C`$sth\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`bind_columns\*(C'\fR.

If there are no more rows or if an error occurs, then \f(CW\*(C`fetchrow_arrayref\*(C'\fR

.Sp
Note that the same array reference is returned for each fetch, so don't
store the reference and then use it after a later fetch.  Also, the
elements of the array are also reused for each row, so take care if you
want to take a reference to an element. See also \*(L"bind_columns\*(R".

An alternative to \f(CW\*(C`fetchrow_arrayref\*(C'\fR. Fetches the next row of data

If there are no more rows or if an error occurs, then \f(CW\*(C`fetchrow_array\*(C'\fR
returns an empty list. You should check \f(CW\*(C`$sth\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR afterwards (or use
the \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR attribute) to discover if the empty list returned was

In a scalar context, \f(CW\*(C`fetchrow_array\*(C'\fR returns the value of the first

The optional \f(CW$name\fR parameter specifies the name of the statement handle
attribute. For historical reasons it defaults to "\f(CW\*(C`NAME\*(C'\fR\*(L", however using either
\&\*(R"\f(CW\*(C`NAME_lc\*(C'\fR\*(L" or \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`NAME_uc\*(C'\fR" is recomended for portability.
.Sp
The keys of the hash are the same names returned by \f(CW\*(C`$sth\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`{$name}\*(C'\fR. If
more than one field has the same name, there will only be one entry in
the returned hash for those fields.

Because of the extra work \f(CW\*(C`fetchrow_hashref\*(C'\fR and Perl have to perform, it
is not as efficient as \f(CW\*(C`fetchrow_arrayref\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`fetchrow_array\*(C'\fR.

before it is either executed again or destroyed.  The \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR method
is rarely needed, but can sometimes be helpful in very specific
situations to allow the server to free up resources (such as sort
buffers).
.Sp
When all the data has been fetched from a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement, the driver
should automatically call \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR for you. So you should not normally
need to call it explicitly.
.Sp
Consider a query like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  SELECT foo FROM table WHERE bar=? ORDER BY foo
.Ve
.Sp
where you want to select just the first (smallest) \*(L"foo\*(R" value from a
very large table. When executed, the database server will have to use
temporary buffer space to store the sorted rows. If, after executing
the handle and selecting one row, the handle won't be re-executed for
some time and won't be destroyed, the \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR method can be used to tell
the server that the buffer space can be freed.
.Sp
Calling \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR resets the \*(L"Active\*(R" attribute for the statement.  It
may also make some statement handle attributes (such as \f(CW\*(C`NAME\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`TYPE\*(C'\fR)
unavailable if they have not already been accessed (and thus cached).
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR method does not affect the transaction status of the
database connection.  It has nothing to do with transactions. It's mostly an
internal \*(L"housekeeping\*(R" method that is rarely needed. There's no need
to call \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR if you're about to destroy or re-execute the statement
handle.  See also \*(L"disconnect\*(R" and the \*(L"Active\*(R" attribute.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`finish\*(C'\fR method should have been called \f(CW\*(C`cancel_select\*(C'\fR.

.Sp
Returns the number of rows affected by the last row affecting command,
or \-1 if the number of rows is not known or not available.
.Sp
Generally, you can only rely on a row count after a \fInon\fR\-\f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR
\&\f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR (for some specific operations like \f(CW\*(C`UPDATE\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`DELETE\*(C'\fR), or
after fetching all the rows of a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement.
.Sp
For \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements, it is generally not possible to know how many
rows will be returned except by fetching them all.  Some drivers will
return the number of rows the application has fetched so far, but
others may return \-1 until all rows have been fetched.  So use of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`rows\*(C'\fR method or \f(CW$DBI::rows\fR with \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements is not
recommended.
.Sp
One alternative method to get a row count for a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR is to execute a
\&\*(L"\s-1SELECT\s0 \s-1COUNT\s0(*) \s-1FROM\s0 ...\*(R" \s-1SQL\s0 statement with the same \*(L"...\*(R" as your
query and then fetch the row count from that.

.Vb 1
\&  $rc = $sth->bind_col($column_number, \e$var_to_bind);

.Sp
Binds an output column (field) of a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement to a Perl variable.
See \f(CW\*(C`bind_columns\*(C'\fR below for an example.  Note that column numbers count
up from 1.
.Sp
Whenever a row is fetched from the database, the corresponding Perl
variable is automatically updated. There is no need to fetch and assign
the values manually.  The binding is performed at a very low level
using Perl aliasing so there is no extra copying taking place.  This
makes using bound variables very efficient.
.Sp
For maximum portability between drivers, \f(CW\*(C`bind_col\*(C'\fR should be called after
\&\f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR. This restriction may be removed in a later version of the \s-1DBI\s0.
.Sp
You do not need to bind output columns in order to fetch data, but it
can be useful for some applications which need either maximum performance
or greater clarity of code.  The \*(L"bind_param\*(R" method
performs a similar but opposite function for input variables.

.Sp
Calls \*(L"bind_col\*(R" for each column of the \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement.
The \f(CW\*(C`bind_columns\*(C'\fR method will die if the number of references does not
match the number of fields.
.Sp
For maximum portability between drivers, \f(CW\*(C`bind_columns\*(C'\fR should be called
after \f(CW\*(C`execute\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  $dbh->{RaiseError} = 1; # do this, or check every call for errors
\&  $sth = $dbh->prepare(q{ SELECT region, sales FROM sales_by_region });
\&  $sth->execute;

.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  # Column binding is the most efficient way to fetch data
\&  while ($sth->fetch) {

.SH "FURTHER INFORMATION"
.IX Header "FURTHER INFORMATION"
.Sh "Transactions"
.IX Subsection "Transactions"
Transactions are a fundamental part of any robust database system. They
protect against errors and database corruption by ensuring that sets of
related changes to the database take place in atomic (indivisible,
all\-or\-nothing) units.
.PP
This section applies to databases that support transactions and where
\&\f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR is off.  See \*(L"AutoCommit\*(R" for details of using \f(CW\*(C`AutoCommit\*(C'\fR
with various types of databases.
.PP
The recommended way to implement robust transactions in Perl
applications is to use \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`eval\ {\ ...\ }\*(C'\fR
(which is very fast, unlike \f(CW\*(C`eval\ "..."\*(C'\fR). For example:
.PP
.Vb 13
\&  $dbh->{AutoCommit} = 0;  # enable transactions, if possible
\&  $dbh->{RaiseError} = 1;
\&  eval {
\&      foo(...)        # do lots of work here
\&      bar(...)        # including inserts
\&      baz(...)        # and updates
\&      $dbh->commit;   # commit the changes if we get this far
\&  };
\&  if ($@) {
\&      warn "Transaction aborted because $@";
\&      $dbh->rollback; # undo the incomplete changes
\&      # add other application on-error-clean-up code here
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
If the \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR attribute is not set, then \s-1DBI\s0 calls would need to be
manually checked for errors, typically like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $h->method(@args) or die $h->errstr;
.Ve
.PP
With \f(CW\*(C`RaiseError\*(C'\fR set, the \s-1DBI\s0 will automatically \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR if any \s-1DBI\s0 method
call on that handle (or a child handle) fails, so you don't have to
test the return value of each method call. See \*(L"RaiseError\*(R" for more
details.
.PP
A major advantage of the \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR approach is that the transaction will be
properly rolled back if \fIany\fR code (not just \s-1DBI\s0 calls) in the inner
application dies for any reason. The major advantage of using the
\&\f(CW\*(C`$h\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`{RaiseError}\*(C'\fR attribute is that all \s-1DBI\s0 calls will be checked
automatically. Both techniques are strongly recommended.
.PP
After calling \f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`rollback\*(C'\fR many drivers will not let you
fetch from a previously active \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement handle that's a child
of the same database handle. A typical way round this is to connect the
the database twice and use one connection for \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statements.
.Sh "Handling \s-1BLOB\s0 / \s-1LONG\s0 / Memo Fields"
.IX Subsection "Handling BLOB / LONG / Memo Fields"
Many databases support \*(L"blob\*(R" (binary large objects), \*(L"long\*(R", or similar
datatypes for holding very long strings or large amounts of binary
data in a single field. Some databases support variable length long
values over 2,000,000,000 bytes in length.
.PP
Since values of that size can't usually be held in memory, and because
databases can't usually know in advance the length of the longest long
that will be returned from a \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR statement (unlike other data
types), some special handling is required.
.PP
In this situation, the value of the \f(CW\*(C`$h\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`{LongReadLen}\*(C'\fR attribute is used
to determine how much buffer space to allocate when fetching such
fields.  The \f(CW\*(C`$h\-\*(C'\fR>\f(CW\*(C`{LongTruncOk}\*(C'\fR attribute is used to determine how to
behave if a fetched value can't fit into the buffer.
.PP
When trying to insert long or binary values, placeholders should be used
since there are often limits on the maximum size of an \f(CW\*(C`INSERT\*(C'\fR
statement and the \*(L"quote\*(R" method generally can't cope with binary
data.  See \*(L"Placeholders and Bind Values\*(R".

.Sh "Threads and Thread Safety"
.IX Subsection "Threads and Thread Safety"
Perl versions 5.004_50 and later include optional experimental support
for multiple threads on many platforms.  If the \s-1DBI\s0 is built using a
Perl that has threads enabled then it will use a per-driver mutex to
ensure that only one thread is with a driver at any one time.
Please note that support for threads in Perl is still experimental and
is known to have some significant problems. It's use is not recommended.
.Sh "Signal Handling and Canceling Operations"
.IX Subsection "Signal Handling and Canceling Operations"
The first thing to say is that signal handling in Perl is currently
\&\fInot\fR safe. There is always a small risk of Perl crashing and/or
core dumping when, or after, handling a signal.  (The risk was reduced
with 5.004_04 but is still present.)
.PP
The two most common uses of signals in relation to the \s-1DBI\s0 are for
canceling operations when the user types Ctrl-C (interrupt), and for
implementing a timeout using \f(CW\*(C`alarm()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW$SIG{ALRM}\fR.
.PP
To assist in implementing these operations, the \s-1DBI\s0 provides a \f(CW\*(C`cancel\*(C'\fR
method for statement handles. The \f(CW\*(C`cancel\*(C'\fR method should abort the current
operation and is designed to be called from a signal handler.
.PP
However, it must be stressed that: a) few drivers implement this at
the moment (the \s-1DBI\s0 provides a default method that just returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR);
and b) even if implemented, there is still a possibility that the statement
handle, and possibly the parent database handle, will not be usable
afterwards.
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`cancel\*(C'\fR returns true, then it has successfully
invoked the database engine's own cancel function.  If it returns false,
then \f(CW\*(C`cancel\*(C'\fR failed. If it returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, then the database
engine does not have cancel implemented.
.SH "DEBUGGING"
.IX Header "DEBUGGING"
In addition to the \*(L"trace\*(R" method, you can enable the same trace
information by setting the \f(CW\*(C`DBI_TRACE\*(C'\fR environment variable before
starting Perl.
.PP
On Unix-like systems using a Bourne-like shell, you can do this easily
on the command line:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  DBI_TRACE=2 perl your_test_script.pl
.Ve
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`DBI_TRACE\*(C'\fR is set to a non-numeric value, then it is assumed to
be a file name and the trace level will be set to 2 with all trace
output appended to that file. If the name begins with a number
followed by an equal sign (\f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR), then the number and the equal sign are
stripped off from the name, and the number is used to set the trace
level. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  DBI_TRACE=1=dbitrace.log perl your_test_script.pl
.Ve
.PP
See also the \*(L"trace\*(R" method.
.PP
It can sometimes be handy to compare trace files from two different
runs of the same script. However using a tool like \f(CW\*(C`diff\*(C'\fR doesn't work
well because the trace file is full of object addresses that may
differ each run. Here's a handy little command to strip those out:
.PP

.Sh "How fast is the \s-1DBI\s0?"
.IX Subsection "How fast is the DBI?"
To measure the speed of the \s-1DBI\s0 and DBD::Oracle code, I modified
DBD::Oracle so you can set an attribute that will cause the
same row to be fetched from the row cache over and over again (without
involving Oracle code but exercising *all* the \s-1DBI\s0 and DBD::Oracle code
in the code path for a fetch).
.PP
The results (on my lightly loaded old Sparc 10) fetching 50000 rows using:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        1 while $csr->fetch;
.Ve
.PP
were:
	one field:   5300 fetches per cpu second (approx)
	ten fields:  4000 fetches per cpu second (approx)
.PP
Obviously results will vary between platforms (newer faster platforms
can reach around 50000 fetches per second), but it does give a feel for
the maximum performance: fast.  By way of comparison, using the code:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        1 while @row = $csr->fetchrow_array;
.Ve
.PP
(\f(CW\*(C`fetchrow_array\*(C'\fR is roughly the same as \f(CW\*(C`ora_fetch\*(C'\fR) gives:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        one field:   3100 fetches per cpu second (approx)
\&        ten fields:  1000 fetches per cpu second (approx)
.Ve
.PP
Notice the slowdown and the more dramatic impact of extra fields.
(The fields were all one char long. The impact would be even bigger for
longer strings.)
.PP
Changing that slightly to represent actually doing something in Perl
with the fetched data:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    while(@row = $csr->fetchrow_array) {
\&        $hash{++$i} = [ @row ];
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
gives:	ten fields:  500 fetches per cpu second (approx)
.PP
That simple addition has *halved* the performance.
.PP
I therefore conclude that \s-1DBI\s0 and DBD::Oracle overheads are small
compared with Perl language overheads (and probably database overheads).
.PP
So, if you think the \s-1DBI\s0 or your driver is slow, try replacing your
fetch loop with just:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        1 while $csr->fetch;
.Ve
.PP
and time that. If that helps then point the finger at your own code. If
that doesn't help much then point the finger at the database, the
platform, the network etc. But think carefully before pointing it at
the \s-1DBI\s0 or your driver.
.PP
(Having said all that, if anyone can show me how to make the \s-1DBI\s0 or
drivers even more efficient, I'm all ears.)

No. The \s-1DBI\s0 has no knowledge or understanding of dates at all.

Individual drivers (DBD::*) may have some date handling code but are
unlikely to have year 2000 related problems within their code. However,
your application code which \fIuses\fR the \s-1DBI\s0 and \s-1DBD\s0 drivers may have
year 2000 related problems if it has not been designed and written well.

To be used with the Apache daemon together with an embedded Perl
