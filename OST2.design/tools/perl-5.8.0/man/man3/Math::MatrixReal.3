does what you would like it to do (a matrix multiplication).
.PP
Also features many important operations and methods: matrix norm,
matrix transposition, matrix inverse, determinant of a matrix, order
and numerical condition of a matrix, scalar product of vectors, vector
product of vectors, vector length, projection of row and column vectors,
a comfortable way for reading in a matrix from a file, the keyboard or
your code, and many more.
.PP
Allows to solve linear equation systems using an efficient algorithm
known as \*(L"L\-R\-decomposition\*(R" and several approximative (iterative) methods.
.PP
Features an implementation of Kleene's algorithm to compute the minimal
costs for all paths in a graph with weighted edges (the \*(L"weights\*(R" being
the costs associated with each edge).

\&\f(CW\*(C`$new_matrix = Math::MatrixReal\->\*(C'\fR\f(CW\*(C`new_from_string($string);\*(C'\fR
.PP
This method allows you to read in a matrix from a string (for
instance, from the keyboard, from a file or from your code).
.PP
The syntax is simple: each row must start with "\f(CW\*(C`[ \*(C'\fR\*(L" and end with
\&\*(R"\f(CW\*(C` ]\en\*(C'\fR\*(L" (\*(R"\f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR\*(L" being the newline character and \*(R"\f(CW\*(C` \*(C'\fR" a space or
tab) and contain one or more numbers, all separated from each other
by spaces or tabs.
.PP
Additional spaces or tabs can be added at will, but no comments.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  $string = "[ 1 2 3 ]\en[ 2 2 -1 ]\en[ 1 1 1 ]\en";
\&  $matrix = Math::MatrixReal->new_from_string($string);
\&  print "$matrix";
.Ve
.PP
By the way, this prints
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  [  1.000000000000E+00  2.000000000000E+00  3.000000000000E+00 ]
\&  [  2.000000000000E+00  2.000000000000E+00 -1.000000000000E+00 ]
\&  [  1.000000000000E+00  1.000000000000E+00  1.000000000000E+00 ]
.Ve
.PP
But you can also do this in a much more comfortable way using the
shell-like \*(L"here\-document\*(R" syntax:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&  $matrix = Math::MatrixReal->new_from_string(<<'MATRIX');
\&  [  1  0  0  0  0  0  1  ]
\&  [  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  ]
\&  [  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  ]
\&  [  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  ]
\&  [  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  ]
\&  [  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  ]
\&  [  1  0  0  0  0  0 -1  ]
\&  MATRIX
.Ve
.PP
You can even use variables in the matrix:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  $c1 =   2  /  3;
\&  $c2 =  -2  /  5;
\&  $c3 =  26  /  9;
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $matrix = Math::MatrixReal->new_from_string(<<"MATRIX");
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 3
\&      [   3    2    0   ]
\&      [   0    3    2   ]
\&      [  $c1  $c2  $c3  ]
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  MATRIX
.Ve
.PP
(Remember that you may use spaces and tabs to format the matrix to
your taste)
.PP
Note that this method uses exactly the same representation for a
matrix as the \*(L"stringify\*(R" operator "": this means that you can convert
any matrix into a string with \f(CW\*(C`$string = "$matrix";\*(C'\fR and read it back
in later (for instance from a file!).
.PP
Note however that you may suffer a precision loss in this process
because only 13 digits are supported in the mantissa when printed!!
.PP
If the string you supply (or someone else supplies) does not obey
the syntax mentioned above, an exception is raised, which can be
caught by \*(L"eval\*(R" as follows:
.PP
.Vb 14
\&  print "Please enter your matrix (in one line): ";
\&  $string = <STDIN>;
\&  $string =~ s/\e\en/\en/g;
\&  eval { $matrix = Math::MatrixReal->new_from_string($string); };
\&  if ($@)
\&  {
\&      print "$@";
\&      # ...
\&      # (error handling)
\&  }
\&  else
\&  {
\&      # continue...
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
or as follows:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  eval { $matrix = Math::MatrixReal->new_from_string(<<"MATRIX"); };
\&  [   3    2    0   ]
\&  [   0    3    2   ]
\&  [  $c1  $c2  $c3  ]
\&  MATRIX
\&  if ($@)
\&  # ...
.Ve
.PP
Actually, the method shown above for reading a matrix from the keyboard
is a little awkward, since you have to enter a lot of \*(L"\en\*(R"'s for the
newlines.
.PP
A better way is shown in this piece of code:
.PP
.Vb 13
\&  while (1)
\&  {
\&      print "\enPlease enter your matrix ";
\&      print "(multiple lines, <ctrl-D> = done):\en";
\&      eval { $new_matrix =
\&          Math::MatrixReal->new_from_string(join('',<STDIN>)); };
\&      if ($@)
\&      {
\&          $@ =~ s/\es+at\eb.*?$//;
\&          print "${@}Please try again.\en";
\&      }
\&      else { last; }
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Possible error messages of the \*(L"\fInew_from_string()\fR\*(R" method are:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  Math::MatrixReal::new_from_string(): syntax error in input string
\&  Math::MatrixReal::new_from_string(): empty input string
.Ve
.PP
If the input string has rows with varying numbers of columns,
the following warning will be printed to \s-1STDERR:\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  Math::MatrixReal::new_from_string(): missing elements will be set to zero!
.Ve
.PP
If everything is okay, the method returns an object reference to the
(newly allocated) matrix containing the elements you specified.

The p\-norm is defined as (sum(x_i^p))^(1/p). In words, it raised
each element to the p\-th power, adds them up, and then takes the
p\-th root of that number. If the string \*(L"Inf\*(R" is passed, the

equal to 2.

This method diagonalizes the symmetric tridiagonal
matrix \fBT\fR. On output, \f(CW$l\fR and \f(CW$V\fR are similar to the
output values described for \fIsym_diagonalize()\fR.

The optional argument \f(CW$Q\fR corresponds to an orthogonal
transformation matrix \fBQ\fR that should be used additionally
during \fBV\fR (eigenvectors) computation. It should be supplied
if the desired eigenvectors correspond to a more general
symmetric matrix \fBM\fR previously reduced by the
\&\fIhouseholder()\fR method, not a mere tridiagonal. If \fBT\fR is
really a tridiagonal matrix, \fBQ\fR can be omitted (it
will be internally created in fact as an identity matrix).

On output, \fBl\fR is a column vector containing all the eigenvalues

On output, \fBT\fR is the obtained symmetric tridiagonal matrix

This method is used to improve the numerical stability when solving

Suppose you have a matrix \*(L"A\*(R" and a vector \*(L"b\*(R" and you want to find
out a vector \*(L"x\*(R" so that \f(CW\*(C`A * x = b\*(C'\fR, i.e., the vector \*(L"x\*(R" which
solves the equation system represented by the matrix \*(L"A\*(R" and the
vector \*(L"b\*(R".
.PP
Applying this method to the pair (A,b) yields a pair (A',b') where
each row has been divided by (the absolute value of) the greatest
coefficient appearing in that row. So this coefficient becomes equal
to \*(L"1\*(R" (or \*(L"\-1\*(R") in the new pair (A',b') (all others become smaller
than one and greater than minus one).
.PP
Note that this operation does not change the equation system itself
because the same division is carried out on either side of the equation
sign!
.PP
The method requires a quadratic (!) matrix "\f(CW$matrix\fR\*(L" and a vector
\&\*(R"\f(CW$vector\fR" for input (the vector must be a column vector with the same
number of rows as the input matrix) and returns a list of two items

Now what does all this help us in solving linear equation systems?
.PP
It helps us because a triangular matrix is the next best thing
that can happen to us besides a diagonal matrix (a matrix that
has non-zero values only on its main diagonal \- in which case
the solution is trivial, simply divide "\f(CW\*(C`b[i]\*(C'\fR\*(L" by \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`A[i,i]\*(C'\fR\*(L"
to get \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`x[i]\*(C'\fR"!).
.PP
To find the solution to our problem "\f(CW\*(C`A * x = b\*(C'\fR", we divide this
problem in parts: instead of solving \f(CW\*(C`A * x = b\*(C'\fR directly, we first
decompose \*(L"A\*(R" into \*(L"L\*(R" and \*(L"R\*(R" and then solve "\f(CW\*(C`L * y = b\*(C'\fR\*(L" and
finally \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`R * x = y\*(C'\fR" (motto: divide and rule!).
.PP
From the illustration above it is clear that solving "\f(CW\*(C`L * y = b\*(C'\fR\*(L"
and \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`R * x = y\*(C'\fR" is straightforward: we immediately know that
\&\f(CW\*(C`y[1] = b[1]\*(C'\fR. We then deduce swiftly that
.PP

Having effortlessly calculated the vector \*(L"y\*(R", we now proceed to
calculate the vector \*(L"x\*(R" in a similar fashion: we see immediately

You can see that \- especially when you have many vectors \*(L"b1\*(R"..\*(L"bk\*(R"

is much more efficient than a straightforward, \*(L"brute force\*(R" approach.

.PP
The method returns an object reference to a new matrix of the same size as
the input matrix containing the inverse of the matrix that you initially
fed into \*(L"\fIdecompose_LR()\fR\*(R" \fB\s-1IF\s0 \s-1THE\s0 \s-1INVERSE\s0 \s-1EXISTS\s0\fR, or an empty list
otherwise.

Therefore, you should always use this method in the following way:
.PP
.Vb 8

\&      # do something with the inverse matrix...
\&  }
\&  else
\&  {
\&      # do something with the fact that there is no inverse matrix...
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Note that by definition (disregarding numerical errors), the product
of the initial matrix and its inverse (or vice\-versa) is always a matrix
containing one's on the main diagonal (elements (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) and
so on) and zero's elsewhere.
.PP
The input matrix is not changed by this method in any way.

In fact this method is just a shortcut for
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
Both input matrices must be quadratic and have the same size, and the result
is meaningful only if one of them is the inverse of the other (for instance,
as returned by the method \*(L"\fIinvert_LR()\fR\*(R").
.PP
The number returned is a measure of the \*(L"condition\*(R" of the given matrix
"\f(CW$matrix\fR", i.e., a measure of the numerical stability of the matrix.
.PP
This number is always positive, and the smaller its value, the better the
condition of the matrix (the better the stability of all subsequent
computations carried out using this matrix).
.PP
Numerical stability means for example that if
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  abs( $vec_correct - $vec_with_error ) < $epsilon
.Ve
.PP
holds, there must be a "\f(CW$delta\fR\*(L" which doesn't depend on the vector
\&\*(R"\f(CW$vec_correct\fR\*(L" (nor \*(R"\f(CW$vec_with_error\fR", by the way) so that

also holds.

In fact the determinant is a by-product of the \s-1LR\s0 decomposition: It is

Currently, the vector product is only defined for 3 dimensions (i.e.,

vectors with a length equal to one) with a one in row \*(R"i" and zero's
elsewhere (this means that you have numbers and vectors as elements

A characteristic property of the vector product is that the resulting
vector is orthogonal to both of the input vectors (if neither of both
is the null vector, otherwise this is trivial), i.e., the scalar product
of each of the input vectors with the resulting vector is always zero.

In fact in some cases, due to the numerical properties (the \*(L"condition\*(R")

greater than by using an approximative (iterative) algorithm like one
of the three implemented here.

There is one major restriction, though: a fix-point iteration is
guaranteed to converge only if the first derivative of the iteration
function has an absolute value less than one in an area around the
point "\f(CWx(*)\fR\*(L" for which \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`Phi( x(*) ) = x(*)\*(C'\fR\*(L" is to be true, and
if the start vector \*(R"\f(CWx(0)\fR" lies within that area!
.PP
This is best verified grafically, which unfortunately is impossible
to do in this textual documentation!
.PP
See literature on Numerical Analysis for details!
.PP
In our case, this restriction translates to the following three conditions:
.PP
There must exist a norm so that the norm of the matrix of the iteration
function, \f(CW\*(C`( En \- A )\*(C'\fR, has a value less than one, the matrix \*(L"A\*(R" may
not have any zero value on its main diagonal and the initial vector
"\f(CWx(0)\fR\*(L" must be \*(R"good enough\*(L", i.e., \*(R"close enough\*(L" to the solution
\&\*(R"\f(CWx(*)\fR".
.PP
(Remember school math: the first derivative of a straight line given by
"\f(CW\*(C`y = a * x + b\*(C'\fR\*(L" is \*(R"a"!)
.PP
The three methods expect a (quadratic!) matrix "\f(CW$matrix\fR\*(L" as their
first argument, a start vector \*(R"\f(CW$x0_vector\fR\*(L", a vector \*(R"\f(CW$b_vector\fR\*(L"
(which is the vector \*(R"b\*(L" in your equation system \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`A * x = b\*(C'\fR\*(L"), in the
case of the \*(R"Relaxation Method\*(L" (\*(R"\s-1RM\s0\*(L"), a real number \*(R"\f(CW$weight\fR\*(L" best
between zero and two, and finally an error limit (real number) \*(R"\f(CW$epsilon\fR".
.PP
(Note that the weight "\f(CW$weight\fR\*(L" used by the \*(R"Relaxation Method\*(L" (\*(R"\s-1RM\s0")
is \fB\s-1NOT\s0\fR checked to lie within any reasonable range!)
.PP
The three methods first test the first two conditions of the three
conditions listed above and return an empty list if these conditions
are not fulfilled.
.PP
Therefore, you should always test their return value using some
code like:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  if ( $xn_vector = $A_matrix->solve_GSM($x0_vector,$b_vector,1E-12) )
\&  {
\&      # do something with the solution...
\&  }
\&  else
\&  {
\&      # do something with the fact that there is no solution...
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Otherwise, they iterate until \f(CW\*(C`abs( Phi(x) \- x ) < epsilon\*(C'\fR.
.PP
(Beware that theoretically, infinite loops might result if the starting
vector is too far \*(L"off\*(R" the solution! In practice, this shouldn't be
a problem. Anyway, you can always press <ctrl\-C> if you think that the
iteration takes too long!)
.PP
The difference between the three methods is the following:
.PP
In the \*(L"Global Step Method\*(R" (\*(L"\s-1GSM\s0\*(R"), the new vector "\f(CW\*(C`x(t+1)\*(C'\fR\*(L"
(called \*(R"y\*(L" here) is calculated from the vector \*(R"\f(CWx(t)\fR\*(L"
(called \*(R"x" here) according to the formula:
.PP
.Vb 5

\&  ) / a[i,i]
.Ve
.PP
In the \*(L"Single Step Method\*(R" (\*(L"\s-1SSM\s0\*(R"), the components of the vector
"\f(CW\*(C`x(t+1)\*(C'\fR" which have already been calculated are used to calculate
the remaining components, i.e.
.PP
.Vb 5

\&  ) / a[i,i]
.Ve
.PP
In the \*(L"Relaxation method\*(R" (\*(L"\s-1RM\s0\*(R"), the components of the vector
"\f(CW\*(C`x(t+1)\*(C'\fR\*(L" are calculated by \*(R"mixing\*(L" old and new value (like
cold and hot water), and the weight \*(R"\f(CW$weight\fR\*(L" determines the
\&\*(R"aperture\*(L" of both the \*(R"hot water tap\*(L" as well as of the \*(R"cold
water tap", according to the formula:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  y[i] =

\&  ) / a[i,i]
\&  y[i] = weight * y[i] + (1 - weight) * x[i]
.Ve
.PP
Note that the weight "\f(CW$weight\fR" should be greater than zero and
less than two (!).

The three methods are supposed to be of different efficiency.

.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $matrix_A += $matrix_B;
.Ve
.IP "'\-'" 5
Subtraction
.Sp
Returns the difference of the two given matrices.
.Sp
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $matrix_D = $matrix_A - $matrix_B;
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $matrix_A -= $matrix_B;
.Ve
.Sp
Note that this is the same as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $matrix_S = $matrix_A + -$matrix_B;
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $matrix_A += -$matrix_B;
.Ve
.Sp
(The latter are less efficient, though)
.IP "'*'" 5
Multiplication
.Sp
Returns the matrix product of the two given matrices or
the product of the given matrix and scalar factor.
.Sp
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $matrix_P = $matrix_A * $matrix_B;
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $matrix_A *= $matrix_B;
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $vector_b = $matrix_A * $vector_x;
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $matrix_B = -1 * $matrix_A;
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $matrix_B = $matrix_A * -1;
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $matrix_A *= -1;
.Ve
.IP "'**'" 5
Exponentiation
.Sp
Returns the matrix raised to an integer power. If 0 is passed,
the identity matrix is returned. If a negative integer is passed,
it computes the inverse (if it exists) and then raised the inverse
to the absolute value of the integer. The matrix must be quadratic.
.Sp
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $matrix2 = $matrix ** 2;
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $matrix **= 2;
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $inv2 = $matrix ** -2;
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ident = $matrix ** 0;
.Ve
.IP "'=='" 5
Equality
.Sp
Tests two matrices for equality.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( $A * $x == $b ) { print "EUREKA!\en"; }
.Ve
.Sp
Note that in most cases, due to numerical errors (due to the finite
precision of computer arithmetics), it is a bad idea to compare two
matrices or vectors this way.
.Sp
Better use the norm of the difference of the two matrices you want
to compare and compare that norm with a small number, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( abs( $A * $x - $b ) < 1E-12 ) { print "BINGO!\en"; }
.Ve
.IP "'!='" 5
Inequality
.Sp
Tests two matrices for inequality.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    while ($x0_vector != $xn_vector) { # proceed with iteration ... }
.Ve
.Sp
(Stops when the iteration becomes stationary)
.Sp
Note that (just like with the '==' operator), it is usually a bad idea
to compare matrices or vectors this way. Compare the norm of the difference
of the two matrices with a small number instead.
.IP "'<'" 5
Less than
.Sp
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( $matrix1 < $matrix2 ) { # ... }
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( $vector < $epsilon ) { # ... }
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( 1E-12 < $vector ) { # ... }
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( $A * $x - $b < 1E-12 ) { # ... }
.Ve
.Sp
These are just shortcuts for saying:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( abs($matrix1) < abs($matrix2) ) { # ... }
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( abs($vector) < abs($epsilon) ) { # ... }
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( abs(1E-12) < abs($vector) ) { # ... }
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( abs( $A * $x - $b ) < abs(1E-12) ) { # ... }
.Ve
.Sp
Uses the \*(L"one\*(R"\-norm for matrices and Perl's built-in \*(L"\fIabs()\fR\*(R" for scalars.
.IP "'<='" 5
Less than or equal
.Sp
As with the '<' operator, this is just a shortcut for the same expression
with \*(L"\fIabs()\fR\*(R" around all arguments.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( $A * $x - $b <= 1E-12 ) { # ... }
.Ve
.Sp
which in fact is the same as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( abs( $A * $x - $b ) <= abs(1E-12) ) { # ... }
.Ve
.Sp
Uses the \*(L"one\*(R"\-norm for matrices and Perl's built-in \*(L"\fIabs()\fR\*(R" for scalars.
.IP "'>'" 5
Greater than
.Sp
As with the '<' and '<=' operator, this
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( $xn - $x0 > 1E-12 ) { # ... }
.Ve
.Sp
is just a shortcut for:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( abs( $xn - $x0 ) > abs(1E-12) ) { # ... }
.Ve
.Sp
Uses the \*(L"one\*(R"\-norm for matrices and Perl's built-in \*(L"\fIabs()\fR\*(R" for scalars.
.IP "'>='" 5
Greater than or equal
.Sp
As with the '<', '<=' and '>' operator, the following
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( $LR >= $A ) { # ... }
.Ve
.Sp
is simply a shortcut for:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    if ( abs($LR) >= abs($A) ) { # ... }
.Ve
.Sp
Uses the \*(L"one\*(R"\-norm for matrices and Perl's built-in \*(L"\fIabs()\fR\*(R" for scalars.
