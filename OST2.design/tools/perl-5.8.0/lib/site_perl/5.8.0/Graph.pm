=head1 NAME

Graph - graph operations

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Graph;

    $g = new Graph;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is just a front-end class for Graph::Directed and Graph::Base.

Instantiated Graph objects (like $g in the the above description)
are in fact Graph::Base objects in disguise, look there for the
methods available.  If you want undirected graphs, create Graph::Undirected
objects.
